# MoLibrary
**MoLibrary** is a comprehensive and scalable web-based Library Management System built to digitize and streamline the real-world operations of libraries. Its purpose is to provide a **smooth, organized, and user-friendly digital solution for managing library activities** — from book inventory and membership plans to borrowing, returning, and fines — all within a unified platform that supports multiple libraries.

It supports various user roles (Super Admin, Library Admin, Librarian, and Member) and includes rich features such as real-time notifications, secure authentication, and plan-based subscriptions — offering a seamless experience for both administrators and members.
